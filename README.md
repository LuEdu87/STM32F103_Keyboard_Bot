# STM32F103_Keyboard_Bot
Project to convert the microcontroller STM32F103 in a Keyboard using the USB Protocol.

## Description
For this project I'm going to use a STM32F103(Blue Pill) for simulate a USB protocol and a KeyPad .
The goal is to store macros in the blue pill and shoot them through the KeyPad.
For example, in the code there's a test. If you push 1 on the keypad, the keyboard will write "hello world".
